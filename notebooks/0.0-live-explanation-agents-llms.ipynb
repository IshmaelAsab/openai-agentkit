This evolution will blur traditional boundaries between individual and collective intelligence, requiring new norms for epistemic responsibility, transparency, and trust as we co-produce knowledge with systems that act autonomously on our behalf. Ethically guided design and governance will be necessary to align agentic behavior with human values, preserve deliberative capacities, and mitigate concentration of power. Ultimately, thinking in this era will become a layered practice—part human judgment, part machine inference—whose promise is amplified only when paired with robust education, critical reflexivity, and institutional safeguards that protect autonomy and flourishing.\")'"
