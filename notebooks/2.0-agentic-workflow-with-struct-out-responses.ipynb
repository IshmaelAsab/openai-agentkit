      "Plan: I’ll first reproduce the failure locally and capture exact symptoms (HTTP status, console & server logs, browser/network trace, screenshots) so we know whether this is a routing, template, asset, CORS/CSP, auth/redirect, or build-cache issue. Next I’ll run the app in debug mode and inspect the landing-page route/controller (e.g., app/routes or pages/index.jsx/tsx, server-side controller, and template files like templates/index.html), the client bundle (webpack/Parcel/Vite build output), middleware (authentication, feature-flag, or A/B tests), and the webserver/proxy config (nginx/CloudFront) to find where the request diverges from expected behavior. I’ll add a minimal failing test or reproduce script, implement a focused fix (route/template/asset-path/redirect/CSP header change or cache invalidation), and unit/integration test the fix (see framework docs: Express routing, Next.js pages, or Django views). Finally I’ll deploy to staging, run smoke tests, and roll out to production with monitoring and a quick rollback plan. Please provide the repo link, branch, error logs, screenshots, and which environment(s) are affected so I can start.\n"
