Montaigne on Friendship — Summary

Context
- Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592), French Renaissance essayist, wrote a long personal essay "Of Friendship" inspired by the death of his close friend Étienne de La Boétie. The piece is less a systematic treatise than a reflective, anecdotal, and philosophical exploration of what real friendship is and why it matters.

The nature of true friendship
- Montaigne draws a sharp distinction between ordinary social ties (family, acquaintances, alliances of interest or pleasure) and the exceptional, almost mystical friendship he venerates. True friendship, for him, is a union in which two minds are so entirely in tune that they feel like "one soul in two bodies." It is intimate, exclusive, and reciprocal.

Voluntary and free
- Friendship must be voluntary and uncoerced. Montaigne emphasizes freedom of choice: genuine friendship cannot be manufactured by duty, law, or calculation. It arises spontaneously between equals who freely give themselves to one another.

Mutuality, equality, and frankness
- Essential features of Montaigne’s ideal friendship are strict reciprocity, equality, and absolute frankness. Friends disclose themselves honestly, correct one another without rivalry, and maintain a balance in giving and receiving. There is no jealousy or competition; the friendship rests on mutual generosity of spirit.

Stability and singularity
- True friendship is rare and durable. Montaigne insists that it cannot be casually replaced or multiplied: a perfect friend is singular, not interchangeable. Once established it endures through trials and separations and survives death in memory and mourning.

A moral and spiritual good
- For Montaigne a deep friendship is not merely pleasurable but morally and spiritually elevating. It fosters self-knowledge, steadiness of character, and a kind of moral courage that ordinary ties do not produce. The friend is both mirror and spur to virtue.

Beyond utility and passion
- Montaigne distinguishes friendship from relationships based on utility, social advantage, or sexual passion. Unlike alliances that depend on benefit or desire, true friendship requires a detachment from self-interest: friends love each other for themselves, not for what they provide.

Not sentimentalizing, but realistic
- Although he celebrates intense devotion, Montaigne does not romanticize friendship into sentimentality. He recognizes its fragility and rarity, and he is candid about the pain of losing a friend (as in his grief for La Boétie). He also warns against dependency and the danger of idolizing another person.

Practical implications
- Because true friendship is so precious and uncommon, Montaigne advises careful choice of companions and cultivation of inward freedom and honesty. He values solitude and self-sufficiency, but prizes friendship as a crowning attainment when it is genuine.

Style and significance
- The essay mixes personal memoir, philosophical reflection, and moral counsel. Montaigne’s account helped to shape later European ideas of friendship by linking intimacy with moral seriousness, and by treating friendship as an essential dimension of a good life rather than merely a social convenience.

In short
- Montaigne holds that where found, a true friendship is one of life’s highest goods: rare, voluntary, equal, frank, morally enriching, and enduring. It transfigures ordinary relations because it is formed not by calculation but by a deep mutual affinity of minds and hearts.
