    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complex Pydantic Models**: You can create rich, nested data structures with `List[CustomModel]` to capture detailed information\n",
    "2. **Structured Report Generation**: Using `responses.parse()` ensures consistent, high-quality output every time\n",
    "3. **Data Transformation**: Structured data (Pydantic objects) can easily be transformed into formatted documents (Markdown, HTML, PDF, etc.)\n",
    "4. **Reusability**: Once you have structured data, you can generate different views or formats without re-calling the API\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional approach:**\n",
    "- Ask AI to \"write a report\"\n",
    "- Get unstructured text\n",
    "- Hard to extract specific information\n",
    "- Inconsistent format across reports\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structured approach (what we did):**\n",
    "- Define exact schema with Pydantic\n",
    "- Get guaranteed structure\n",
    "- Easy to access specific fields\n",
    "- Consistent reports every time\n",
    "- Can store in databases, generate multiple formats, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Try:\n",
    "- Adding more papers and comparing reports\n",
    "- Creating a database of structured reports\n",
    "- Building a web interface to browse reports\n",
    "- Generating reports in different formats (HTML, PDF)\n",
    "- Adding citation information and references"
