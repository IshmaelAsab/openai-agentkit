Context Engineering 2.0: The Context of Context Engineering,"The paper defines and situates context engineering as the systematic process of designing, organizing, and managing contextual information to reduce entropy between human intentions and machine understanding, traces its evolution over four eras from early HCI/context-aware systems to speculative superhuman intelligence, formalizes context and context engineering mathematically, and proposes design considerations for context collection, management, and usage while identifying open challenges and future directions.","The introduction motivates context engineering by highlighting the impact of context on LLM and agent behavior, argues that context engineering predates modern LLM practices (rooted in ubiquitous computing and HCI), and frames the core task as compressing high-entropy human contexts into machine-understandable low-entropy representations.","The paper formalizes context with mathematical definitions (entities, Char, Context) and defines context engineering as a transformation CE:(C,T)→f_context composed from modular operations (ϕi), and it proposes a four-stage evolutionary characterization (Era 1.0–4.0) tied to machine intelligence levels.","Rather than empirical experiments, the paper presents a conceptual and historical analysis: a comparison of Era 1.0 vs 2.0 practices, catalogs of context collection/storage/management/usage techniques (e.g., multimodal encoding, hierarchical memory, subagents, RAG, embeddings), representative system patterns and applications (CLI, deep research agents, BCIs), and a set of emerging engineering practices and trade-offs.","The discussion highlights key challenges for lifelong and large-scale context engineering (storage bottlenecks, processing degradation, system instability, evaluation difficulty), argues for new architectures and a ‘‘semantic operating system’’ for context, and forecasts increasing machine responsibility in interpreting and constructing context as intelligence advances."
Efﬁcient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space,"The paper introduces two efficient model architectures (Continuous Bag-of-Words — CBOW — and Continuous Skip-gram) for learning continuous word vector representations from very large datasets, achieving state-of-the-art syntactic and semantic analogy performance with much lower computational cost and practical training times on billions of words.","The authors motivate moving beyond atomic word representations to distributed continuous vectors (learned by neural methods) to capture multiple degrees of similarity and linear regularities (e.g., vector arithmetic like king - man + woman = queen), and set the goal of learning high-quality vectors from massive corpora and large vocabularies.","They propose two log-linear architectures—CBOW (predict current word from averaged context vectors) and Skip-gram (predict surrounding words given the current word)—use hierarchical softmax (Huffman tree) and SGD (with Adagrad) to reduce complexity, analyze per-example computational costs, and implement large-scale parallel training in the DistBelief framework.","Experimentally, Skip-gram yields the best semantic analogy performance and CBOW is very efficient on syntactic tasks; both outperform or match prior NNLM/RNNLM vectors on a comprehensive semantic–syntactic analogy test and, when combined with RNNLMs, improve performance on the Microsoft Sentence Completion Challenge; models train in hours–days on multi-billion-word corpora.","The paper concludes that very simple, computationally efficient architectures can produce high-quality, scalable word vectors suitable for large corpora (and practical NLP use), releases code and pretrained vectors (word2vec), and outlines promising applications and directions for further scaling and improvements."
