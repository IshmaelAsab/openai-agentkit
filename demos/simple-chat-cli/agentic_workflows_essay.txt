Agentic workflows describe coordinated processes in which autonomous agents—software modules, 
robots, or decision-making systems—carry out tasks toward shared goals. These workflows structure 
how agents perceive their environment, select and sequence actions, and exchange information to achieve 
objectives with minimal human intervention. Key components include clearly defined objectives, agent 
capabilities and constraints, communication channels, and feedback mechanisms that allow agents to adapt 
to changing conditions and recover from errors.

The advantages of agentic workflows include improved scalability, faster decision-making, and the ability 
to handle complex or distributed tasks that would overwhelm a single monolithic system. However, they 
introduce challenges around trust, safety, and transparency. Ensuring alignment between agent behaviors 
and human intentions requires careful specification of reward structures or objectives, robust monitoring 
to detect undesirable actions, and methods for explaining agent decisions so that stakeholders can audit 
and intervene when necessary.

Practical application of agentic workflows is already visible in logistics, customer service automation, 
and multi-robot coordination for inspection or search-and-rescue. Best practices for designing these workflows 
emphasize modularity, fail-safe mechanisms, and iterative testing in realistic environments with human-in-the-loop
controls during early deployment. Governance and continuous evaluation—using metrics for performance, safety incidents,
and alignment—help maintain system reliability and public trust as agentic workflows take on increasingly consequential roles.
